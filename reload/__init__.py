Reload is a tool to reload Amazon gift card balances. Many banks and credit unions offer
high-yield interest rates for savings/checking accounts for spending a certain amount of
money or meeting a specified amount of charges each month. This tool provides an
automated interface to "set it and forget it". You configure each of your cards, how
many reloads should be run each month, and Reload will take care of ensuring that you
meet the requirements to qualify for higher interest rates.

Another useful scenario is to add unused credit cards. In many cases, CC companies will
wave <$1 charges each month, so you can use this tool to spend small amounts of money to
keep the account open and ensure there is an active history for the CC.
